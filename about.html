        <p>
            Cuudex is intended as a stream browsing site for Pupals looking for a Féileacán Cú stream or collab to 
            (re)watch or recommend. Cuu has had no hand in it, it's simply a passion project born from a wish to tag 
            streams to filter them more easily, as well as my own frustration at the lack of various Youtube functionlity. 
            It might also be a not-at-all delayed birthday gift for some old guy and his ancient body roomie... 
            Surely all of November still counts, right..?
        </p>
        <p>
            The stream tags are subjective opinion, but I try to make them generally acceptable, and will consider 
            suggestions carefully! I try to keep them pretty high-level (without spoilers or trigger warnings), so that while most (*cough* all) streams make me 
            laugh, mainly the ones centred around humerous games are tagged "Funny". That's probably my worst choice for a 
            tag, actually... Regarding submitted Tag Suggestions, I have to review them manually due to technical 
            limitations (like the lack of an actual server). I'm sorry if your suggestion doesn't come through, 
            please bear with me, I'm <i>~juuust a wan~</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Tragically, graphic design is not my passion. And I'm not actually that good at making websites, but here we are.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to reach out to me on Discord, username <b>Cuudexter</b>, especially if there's a collab stream I've missed after a few days, or if there's something weird about the tags!
        </p>

            Have a wonderful day, everywan.
